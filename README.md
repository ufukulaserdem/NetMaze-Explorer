# 🌐 NetMaze Explorer – Hybrid Networking on Azure

**NetMaze Explorer** is a practical Azure networking lab project designed to simulate a hybrid cloud environment. It walks through building secure connectivity between on-premises infrastructure and Azure resources using Virtual Networks, Bastion, NSGs, VPN Gateway, and Private Endpoints.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build and connect multiple Azure VNets
- Configure secure access using Bastion and NSGs
- Simulate on-premise connectivity with a VPN Gateway and Local Network Gateway
- Host an internal web application via Private Endpoint
- Practice key **AZ-104** networking concepts

## 🧱 Architecture Components

| Component             | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| VNet-A               | Main VNet for admin access and Bastion |
| VNet-B               | Application VNet hosting VPN Gateway and Web App |
| Network Peering      | Enables internal traffic between VNets |
| NSG                  | Restricts access to specific subnets |
| Bastion              | Secure RDP/SSH without public IPs |
| VPN Gateway          | Establishes Site-to-Site connection with on-prem |
| Private Endpoint     | Provides internal-only access to Web App |
| App Service          | Hosts internal web application |
